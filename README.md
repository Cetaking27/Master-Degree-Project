## MASTER THESIS PROJECT
### Methods of negatives moment of randoms variables

This thesis consists of three chapters:
1. **Theoretical Overview**: It explains statistical moments, their use in data analysis, and the formal definition and role of the inverse moment in characterizing distributions, compared to other moments like mean and variance.
2. **Interpretation of the Inverse Moment**: It explores how the inverse moment helps interpret data, its relationship with the distribution shape (skewness), and examples in different contexts.
3. **Analysis in Various Distributions**: This chapter analyzes the inverse moment in several distributions, its effect on skewed distributions, and provides practical examples.

The use of negative moments is important for understanding the behavior of random variables, especially in assessing the likelihood of extreme events, such as early failures or short lifespans. Negative moments help characterize the tail behavior of distributions, providing insights into the reliability and risk of systems. They are particularly useful in fields like:

- **Reliability and Risk Analysis**: Assessing product lifespans, system failures, and maintenance schedules.
- **Life Testing**: Estimating failure times in various products or systems.
- **Survival Analysis**: Analyzing time-to-event data in medical and healthcare settings.
- **Finance and Insurance**: Evaluating large losses and assessing financial risks.

Negative moments are essential for making informed decisions in engineering, healthcare, finance, and other industries where predicting failure or assessing risk is critical.
